## **Installation Instructions**

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Salewitcher/star-wardrobe.git
   cd star-wardrobe

# Deployment
The project was developed using a VS Code workspace. The code was committed to Git and pushed to GitHub using the terminal. The web application is deployed on Heroku as GitHub Pages is not able to host a Python project. Static and media files are being stored in AWS S3. The repository is hosted on GitHub.

## How To Use This Project
To use and further develop this project you can either fork or clone the repository.

### Fork GitHub Repository
By forking the GitHub repository you can make a copy of the original repository on your GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository, by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Navigate to the main page of the GitHub Repository that you want to fork.
3. At the top right of the Repository just below your profile picture, locate the "Fork" button.
4. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
5. Changes made to the forked repository can be merged with the original repository via a pull request.

### Clone GitHub Repository
By cloning a GitHub repository you can create a local copy on your computer of the remote repository. The developer who clones a repository can synchronize their copy of the codebase with any updates made by fellow developers with push or pull requests. Cloning is done by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Navigate to the main page of the GitHub Repository that you want to clone.
3. Above the list of files, click the dropdown called "Code".
4. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "HTTPS", copy the link.
5. Open Git Bash.
6. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
7. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 4.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

8. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remote: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```

Changes made on the local machine (cloned repository) can be pushed to the upstream repository directly if you have write access to the repository. Otherwise, the changes made in the cloned repository are first pushed to the forked repository, and then a pull request is created.

Click [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github) to retrieve pictures for some of the buttons and more detailed explanations of the above process.

## Project Set Up After Forking or Cloning

1. Install all dependencies by typing in the CLI:
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Create a `.gitignore` file and `env.py` file in the project's root directory. Add the `env.py` file to `.gitignore`.
3. Inside the `env.py` file, enter the project's environment variables:

   ```python
   import os
   os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "<your_secret_key>")
   os.environ.setdefault("DEVELOPMENT", '1')
   os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "<your_key>")
   os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "<your_key>")
   os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "<your_key>")
   ```

4. You can get the keys from:
   - "SECRET_KEY" can be generated using [Django Secret Key Generator](https://djecrety.ir/)
   - "STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY" and "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY" can be generated by creating a [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) account. The keys are found in the 'Developers' section under 'API Keys'.
   - In the Developer Section, under 'Webhooks', add a new endpoint for "STRIPE_WH_SECRET". On Endpoint URL, enter:
     ```
     https://<your_host_url>/checkout/wh/
     ```
   - Select to listen to all events, create the endpoint, and retrieve your "STRIPE_WH_SECRET".

5. Make migrations to set up the initial database operations:
   ```bash
   python3 manage.py makemigrations
   python3 manage.py migrate
   ```
6. Load data for the database or create data manually:
   ```bash
   python3 manage.py loaddata <app_name>
   ```
7. Create a superuser:
   ```bash
   python3 manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
8. The project should now be ready for development. To run the project, type in the CLI terminal:
   ```bash
   python3 manage.py runserver
   ```

| USE_AWS | True |

4. If you haven't installed it, install `dj_database_url` and `psycopg2`:
```sh
pip3 install dj_database_url
pip3 install psycopg2-binary
```
Note: You don't have to do this if you've installed all dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file.

5. Set up a new database for the site by going to the project's `settings.py` and importing `dj_database_url`. Comment out the database's default configuration, and replace it with:
```python
DATABASES = {
  'default': dj_database_url.parse('YOUR_DATABASE_URL_FROM_HEROKU')
}
```

6. Run migrations:
```sh
python3 manage.py migrate
```

7. Import data to the database:
```sh
./manage.py dumpdata --exclude auth.permission --exclude contenttypes > db.json
```
Switch to the Postgres database, then load the data:
```sh
./manage.py loaddata db.json
```

8. Set up a new superuser:
```sh
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

9. Update `settings.py` to use Postgres on Heroku and SQLite locally:
```python
if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
   DATABASES = {
      'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
   }
else:
   DATABASES = {
      'default': {
         'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
         'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
      }
   }
```

10. Install Gunicorn:
```sh
pip3 install gunicorn
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```

11. Create a `Procfile` with the following content:
```sh
web: gunicorn shoes_and_more.wsgi:application
```

12. Login to Heroku CLI and disable collectstatic temporarily:
```sh
heroku login
heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app shoes-and-more
```

13. Update `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in `settings.py`:
```python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['shoes-and-more.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
```

14. Add, commit, and push to GitHub, then deploy to Heroku:
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to Heroku"
git push origin main
heroku git:remote -a shoes-and-more
git push heroku main
```

15. Connect Heroku to GitHub via the Heroku dashboard:
   - Navigate to the app's dashboard on Heroku.
   - Click on Deploy.
   - Connect the app to GitHub by searching for the repository and clicking "Connect".
   - Enable automatic deployment by clicking "Enable Automatic Deploys".

16. Update `SECRET_KEY` in `settings.py`:
```python
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', '')
```

17. Set `DEBUG` to True only when the development environment variable exists:
```python
DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ
```

## **3. Connect Django to AWS S3**

### **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip3 install boto3 django-storages
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```

### **Update Django Settings**
1. **Add `storages` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`**

2. **Configure AWS Storage (in `settings.py`)**
```python
if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
    # Cache control
    AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
        'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
        'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
    }

    # Bucket Config
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'YOUR_BUCKET_NAME'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'YOUR_REGION'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

    # Static & Media files
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
    STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
    MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

    # Override static & media URLs
    STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
    MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
```

3. **Set Config Vars on Heroku**
   - Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Reveal Config Vars**.
   - Add:
     | Variable               | Value |
